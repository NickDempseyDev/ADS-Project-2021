# ADS-Project-2021

Link to repository: https://github.com/NickDempseyDev/ADS-Project-2021

Group Members: Dominik Guzowski, Nicholas Dempsey, Adriana Hrabowych, Dáithí Geary
Everything was coded using VScode Liveshare, a tool where peers can program live together, with a voice call at the same time so no one group member did any part themselves. Also the documents were done using google drive which is also live documentation. It was all collaborated so we can’t really create a list of what each member did as we coded over each other a lot.
